- ## Create things
  I love [building little projects](/make) that make people's life easier. I use technology, code and good design.

- ## Improve life
  I try to [build good habits](/habits). I'm positive and minimalist. I enjoy stoic discomforts. I take a cold shower every day.

- ## Explore the world
  I travel at least three months per year. I take long walks. I love being proven wrong. I love to study masterful machines, ideas, buildings and systems.

- ## Live with conscience
  My two best friends and I share an apartment in Vienna, Austria. We eat vegan, cook at home and go dumpster diving.
  I've never tried a cigarette or drugs and had only sips of alcohol.
  I believe in self-study and location-independent entrepreneurship.

- ## Write
  I believe in simple language.
